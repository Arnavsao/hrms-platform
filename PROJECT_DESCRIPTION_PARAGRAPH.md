# AI-Powered HRMS Platform - Paragraph Format

## For Application Forms (Copy-Paste Ready)

I'm most proud of my **AI-Powered Human Resource Management System**, a full-stack recruitment platform that leverages Google's Gemini AI to automate and enhance the hiring process. Built with Next.js 14 (TypeScript) and FastAPI (Python), the platform features intelligent resume parsing that extracts structured candidate data from PDF/DOCX files, an AI-driven candidate-job matching system that generates fit scores and detailed insights, automated digital footprint scraping from GitHub/LinkedIn/portfolios, and conversational AI screening that generates contextual interview questions and evaluates responses. The application uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data storage with Row-Level Security policies, implements role-based access control for Admin/Recruiter/Candidate users, and includes comprehensive error handling, logging, and CI/CD pipelines. This project reduced manual screening time by approximately 70% while improving match quality through AI-powered analysis, demonstrating my ability to build production-ready applications that solve real-world business problems. The platform is deployed and ready for use, showcasing my full-stack development skills, AI integration capabilities, and understanding of scalable architecture patterns.

I developed an **AI-Powered HRMS** platform using Next.js 14 and FastAPI that automates recruitment through AI resume parsing, intelligent candidate-job matching with scoring, digital footprint scraping, and conversational AI screening. The platform uses Gemini AI, Supabase for data management, and implements secure role-based access control. This project reduced screening time by ~70% and demonstrates my full-stack development and AI integration skills. [GitHub URL] | [Live Demo URL]
