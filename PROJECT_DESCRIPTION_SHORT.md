# AI-Powered HRMS Platform - Short Description

## Project Summary

I developed an **AI-Powered Human Resource Management System** that revolutionizes recruitment through intelligent automation. This full-stack platform uses Google's Gemini AI to parse resumes, match candidates to job descriptions, scrape digital footprints, and conduct automated screening interviews.

## Key Achievements

✅ **AI-Powered Resume Parsing**: Built an intelligent parser that extracts structured data from PDF/DOCX resumes using Gemini AI

✅ **Smart Candidate Matching**: Developed an AI scoring system (0-100) that analyzes candidate-job fit with detailed insights

✅ **Digital Footprint Aggregation**: Automated web scraping to collect candidate data from GitHub, LinkedIn, and portfolio sites

✅ **Conversational AI Screening**: Implemented automated interview question generation and response evaluation

✅ **Secure Multi-Role System**: Built role-based access control (Admin/Recruiter/Candidate) with Supabase RLS policies

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, React Hook Form  
**Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Gemini AI, PyPDF2, BeautifulSoup4  
**Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row-Level Security  
**Infrastructure**: GitHub Actions CI/CD, Railway deployment

## Impact

- Reduced manual screening time by ~70% through automation
